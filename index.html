        <h1>The origin of scrum</h1>
        <h2>What is Scrum? Where is it from? Why dit it arise?</h2>
        <p>
          Scrum is an evolution of Agile Management. The Scrum proces is created
          in one of the last years of the 20th century by Jeff Sutherland and
          Ken Schwaber. <br />
          The older alternative of waterfall development, typically goes through
          a lengthy planning process which could take a long time, followed by a
          building process which could also take a long time. Then testing,
          reviewing and eventually deploying the product. This method assumes
          software development is a well understood process without unexpected
          outcomes or problems, which of course is not true. Software
          development is very unpredictable for multiple reasons. That is why a
          new method was needed. Scrum.
        </p>

        <h2>How does Scrum relate to Agile working?</h2>
        <p>
          Agile is an other word for flexible, manoeuvrable or for instance
          versatile. <br />
          Agile is a philosophy, a number of principles to be able to work
          flexible. <br />
          Scrum is not synonymous with Agile working. <br />
          Scrum is an agile way to develop products. Scrum is a framework with
          defined roles and meetings. Therefore it is one of the ways to work
          Agile.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is Scrum specifically so suitable for development work?</h2>
        <p>
          Working according to scrum you can quickly set goals and adjust them
          if necessary. This makes it possible to respond quickly to the wishes
          of the client or user.

        <h2>
          What is a "Retro" (Retrospective)? What is/isn't discussed during the
          Retro? When do you have a Retro (in which phase)?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The entire development team participates in the sprint retrospective
          which is held at the end of a sprint to evaluate what went well and
          reflects on anything that must be improved upon in the next sprint for
          more efficient delivery. All that can improve the teamâ€™s work, is up
          for discussion. It is a time-boxed event (anywhere fronm one to three
          hours).
        </p>
        <h2>
          What is a Refinement? What is/isn't discussed during the Refinement?
          When do you have a Refinement (in which phase)?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Refinement, also known as backlog grooming, is an optional scrum event
          that helps product owners prioritize product backlog. During
          refinement, the product owner and some or all of the team members
          review the backlog items together. There is no specific schedule for
          backlog refinement. It can be scheduled as frequently as needed or not
          at all. The product owner facilitates these meetings and invites the
          relevant parties as needed.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What is a Stand-Up? What is/isn't discussed during the Standup? When
          do you have a Standup (in which phase)?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A stand-up meeting, also called a daily scrum meeting, is a meeting
          where everyone on the team joins at the scrum board in the morning,
          before the working day really starts. Everyone stands (stand-up). The
          meeting may last a maximum of 15 minutes. This way you are forced to
          meet efficiently. You don't go into too much detail. The Scrum Master
          is the process leader of the meeting. Each team member answers 3
          questions during the meeting: - What did you work on yesterday? - What
          will you be doing today? - are there any obstacles blocking your
          progress?

          The product backlog is a list of features (User Stories) to be
          performed during product development. It contains changes and
          extensions that must be applied to the product. The Product Owner
          makes a classification according to priority.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What is the Sprint backlog? What is and is not in it? How does this
          differ from the Product backlog?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The sprint backlog is a list of the highest priority User Stories in
          the Product Backlog. This means that these tasks are taken up first.

          What is a Burndown Chart? What exactly is "burned"? What do you need
          to know this?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Burndown Chart makes the teamwork visible. It is a graphical
          representation of work left to do versus time. It motivates team
          members at the individual level, offers a good vision for
          decision-making and task tracking activities, and enables the team to
          identify obstacles early.
